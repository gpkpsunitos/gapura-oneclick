## Critical Rendering Path (CRP) Optimization

The Critical Rendering Path dictates how quickly the browser converts HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into painted pixels. 

### DOs
*   **DO inline critical CSS**: Extract styles necessary for above-the-fold content and inject them directly into the HTML `<head>`. Defer the rest of the stylesheet.
*   **DO use `async` or `defer` for all non-critical scripts**: Prevent JavaScript from blocking the DOM parser. Use `defer` for scripts that depend on the DOM or each other, and `async` for independent scripts. `type="module"` is preferred for modern JavaScript and is deferred by default so no need to have an explicit `defer` attribute but you can use `async` on independent module scripts.
*   **DO split CSS by media queries**: Use the `media` attribute on `<link>` tags so the browser downloads unused stylesheets (e.g., print styles or desktop styles on mobile) without blocking the render.
*   **DO utilize resource hints**: Add `preconnect` or `dns-prefetch` for essential third-party domains (e.g., font foundries or API endpoints) to establish early TLS handshakes.

### DON'Ts
*   **DON'T use `@import` in CSS**: This creates sequential request chains that delay the CSS Object Model (CSSOM) construction.
*   **DON'T place large, non-critical JavaScript in the `<head>`**: This halts DOM construction until the script is downloaded, parsed, and executed.
*   **DON'T load invisible or unreachable CSS/JS**: Ensure build tools apply tree-shaking and CSS minification to drop unreachable code before deployment.

### Code Examples

**HTML: Deferring Non-Critical CSS & Scripts**
```html
<!-- Inline critical styles directly in head -->
<style>
  body { margin: 0; font-family: system-ui; }
  .hero { min-height: 100vh; }
</style>

<!-- Defer non-critical CSS -->
<link rel="preload" href="non-critical.css" as="style" onload="this.onload=null;this.rel='stylesheet'">
<noscript><link rel="stylesheet" href="non-critical.css"></noscript>

<!-- Load CSS conditionally based on viewport -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mobile.css" media="(max-width: 768px)">

<!-- Defer JavaScript execution -->
<script defer src="app-bundle.js"></script>
```

### The Resource Hint Navigator

| Hint | Tool Use Case | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `preconnect` | Resolve TLS/DNS for known third-party APIs | API endpoints, font services |
| `dns-prefetch` | Lean fallback for non-critical third-party origins | Ad servers, analytics fallbacks |
| `preload` | Same-origin asset needed *now* for rendering | Hero images, render-blocking fonts |
| `prefetch` | Assets needed for next-page navigation | Next-page bundle, detail views |

**Single-Sentence Mental Model**: "Preconnect for domains, Preload for viewport, Prefetch for futures."

## Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) & Resource Fetching

LCP measures the time required to render the largest visible text or image block within the viewport. Optimize LCP by prioritizing visible elements and prepolishing.

### DOs
*   **DO use `fetchpriority="high"` on the LCP image**: Signal to the browser's heuristic engine to elevate the image's priority above scripts and non-critical assets.
*   **DO declare the LCP image in standard HTML**: Ensure the `<img>` tag is present in the raw HTML response so the preload scanner discovers it immediately. Avoid relying on JavaScript to mount the LCP element.
*   **DO preload background images acting as LCP**: If the LCP element is a CSS `background-image`, force early discovery using `<link rel="preload" as="image">` coupled with `fetchpriority="high"`.
*   **DO use `fetchpriority="low"` to demote competing elements**: Lower the priority of large images or carousels that appear above the fold but are *not* the primary LCP element.

### DON'Ts
*   **DON'T lazy-load the LCP image**: Never apply `loading="lazy"` to above-the-fold images. This purposefully delays the fetch until layout calculation is complete, severely degrading LCP.
*   **DON'T overuse `fetchpriority="high"`**: Prioritization is a zero-sum mechanism. Elevating too many resources creates network contention and negates the benefit.
*   **DON'T implement complex JavaScript loaders for the hero section**: Client-side rendering of the LCP element introduces substantial request chains (HTML -> JS -> Execution -> Image Request).

### Code Examples

**HTML: LCP Image Optimization**
```html
<!-- Standard LCP Image -->
<img 
  src="/images/hero.webp" 
  alt="Hero Product" 
  fetchpriority="high" 
  decoding="sync"
  width="1200" 
  height="600"
>

<!-- Preloading a CSS-based LCP background -->
<link rel="preload" as="image" href="/images/bg-hero.webp" fetchpriority="high" type="image/webp">

<!-- Demoting an above-the-fold non-LCP carousel image -->
<img src="/images/carousel-2.webp" fetchpriority="low" alt="Slide 2">
```

## Interaction to Next Paint (INP) & Main Thread Unblocking

INP measures the latency of all interactive events across the page's lifecycle. Poor INP is caused by long-running JavaScript tasks blocking the main thread. 

### DOs
*   **DO break up long tasks**: Any JavaScript execution exceeding 50ms should be split. Yield to the main thread frequently so the browser can process pending user inputs.
*   **DO use `scheduler.yield()` with a fallback**: Utilize the modern `scheduler.yield()` API to place task continuations at the *front* of the queue, falling back to `setTimeout` wrapped in a Promise for unsupported browsers.
*   **DO debounce or throttle rapid event listeners**: Limit the execution frequency of handlers attached to `scroll`, `resize`, or rapid `input` events.
*   **DO separate UI updates from heavy computations**: Update the UI synchronously to provide immediate visual feedback, then push background processing to a Web Worker or deferred task.

### DON'Ts
*   **DON'T rely solely on `setTimeout(..., 0)` for continuous yielding**: Standard `setTimeout` places continuations at the *back* of the task queue, potentially causing long delays if other tasks are pending.
*   **DON'T cause layout thrashing**: Avoid interleaving DOM reads (`offsetHeight`, `getBoundingClientRect`) and writes (`style.height`) within the same loop. Batch DOM reads, then batch DOM writes.
*   **DON'T block the thread with recurring timers**: Avoid heavy polling with `setInterval` that starves the main thread.

### Code Examples

**JS: `scheduler.yield` Polyfill and Usage**
```javascript
// Polyfill for yielding to main thread
async function yieldToMain() {
  if ('scheduler' in window && 'yield' in scheduler) {
    return await scheduler.yield();
  }
  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 0));
}

// Processing a large array without blocking user input
async function processLargeList(items) {
  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
    processItem(items[i]);
    
    // Yield every 50 iterations to allow rendering/interaction
    if (i % 50 === 0) {
      await yieldToMain();
    }
  }
}
```

### Main Thread Task Slicing Heuristic

**The 50ms Rule for INP**:
- **< 50ms**: Execute synchronously.
- **50ms - 250ms**: Slice tasks and yield with `scheduler.yield()`.
- **> 250ms**: Offload to a Web Worker.

## Third-Party Script Management

Third-party scripts (analytics, ads, chat widgets) are the primary source of main thread congestion.

### DOs
*   **DO avoid third-party scripts blocking main content**: Use `defer` with all third-party scripts unless critical to the page load and load them in the footer of the page, rather than the `<head>`.
*   **DO self-host critical third-party dependencies**: Reduce DNS lookups and enforce custom `Cache-Control` logic by hosting third-party libraries on the origin domain.

### Code Examples

**HTML: Third-Party Script Execution**
```html
<!-- 1. Place third-party scripts near the end of the page with the defer attribute -->
<script defer src="http://www.example.com/third-party.js"></script>
```

## CSS Rendering & Containment Optimization

Rendering involves Layout, Style, Paint, and Compositing calculations. CSS Containment limits the scope of these calculations which is useful on large, complex pages where such calculations can cause performance problems.

### DOs
*   **DO use `content-visibility: auto` on off-screen sections on large, complex pages**: Instruct the browser to skip layout and paint calculations for entire subtrees until they approach the viewport.
*   **DO pair `content-visibility` with `contain-intrinsic-size`**: Prevent layout shifts and scrollbar jumping by providing a placeholder height/width for unrendered containers.
*   **DO apply explicit CSS containment (`contain`)**: For isolated UI components (like modals or widgets), use `contain: layout style paint` to prevent internal changes from triggering page-wide reflows.

### DON'Ts
*   **DON'T apply `content-visibility: auto` on smaller, simpler pages**: The gains will be negligible and there are risks of side effects with content jumping.
*   **DON'T apply `content-visibility: auto` to above-the-fold content**: The browser will still evaluate it, but forcing it through the containment engine unnecessarily adds slight overhead to visible elements.
*   **DON'T overuse `will-change` globally**: Indiscriminately applying `will-change: transform` to multiple elements consumes excessive VRAM, causing GPU crashes or sluggish rendering.
*   **DON'T forget accessibility when hiding elements**: `content-visibility: auto` keeps elements in the DOM for screen readers. If content should be truly hidden from assistive technology when off-screen, manage `aria-hidden` attributes manually.

### Code Examples

**CSS: Content Visibility and Containment**
```css
/* Optimize a long list of articles below the fold */
.article-list-item {
  content-visibility: auto;
  contain-intrinsic-size: auto 600px; /* Provides a 600px placeholder */
}

/* Scope a complex widget to prevent layout thrashing */
.isolated-widget {
  contain: layout style paint;
}

/* Hardware accelerate an animation only on hover */
.interactive-button:hover {
  will-change: transform;
  transform: scale(1.05);
}
```

## Modern Image & Media Optimization

Images typically represent the largest payload on a given web page. Optimization requires format negotiation, responsive sizing, and layout stabilization.

### DOs
*   **DO serve modern formats (AVIF / WebP)**: Use the `<picture>` element to offer AVIF (best compression), falling back to WebP, and finally JPEG/PNG for legacy browsers.
*   **DO apply explicit `width` and `height` attributes**: Setting native attributes allows the browser to compute the aspect ratio immediately, reserving space and eliminating CLS. Image dimensions may be set either as HTML attributes or CSS properties.
*   **DO utilize `loading="lazy"` on all below-the-fold images**: Utilize native browser lazy loading to defer network requests for images outside the initial viewport.
*   **DO implement responsive images with `srcset` and `sizes`**: Serve tailored resolutions based on screen density and viewport width to prevent mobile devices from downloading desktop-sized images.

### DON'Ts
*   **DON'T lazy load above-the-fold images**: This directly harms LCP. Visible images must use `loading="eager"` (the default).
*   **DON'T delete necessary dimensions**: Failing to specify width/height on lazy loaded images causes layout shifts.
*   **DON'T omit the `sizes` attribute when using `srcset`**: Without `sizes`, the browser assumes `100vw` and downloads the largest available image.

### Code Examples

**HTML: Comprehensive Responsive Image Component**
```html
<picture>
  <!-- Modern Formats with Source Negotiation -->
  <source type="image/avif" srcset="hero-400w.avif 400w, hero-800w.avif 800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 50vw">
  <source type="image/webp" srcset="hero-400w.webp 400w, hero-800w.webp 800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 50vw">
  
  <!-- Fallback + Dimensions + Priority for Above-The-Fold -->
  <img 
    src="hero-800w.jpg" 
    alt="Descriptive text" 
    width="800" 
    height="600"
    fetchpriority="high"
    loading="eager"
  >
</picture>

<!-- Below-The-Fold Image -->
<img 
    src="footer-icon.png" 
    alt="Footer Logo" 
    width="100" 
    height="100"
    loading="lazy"
>

<!-- DO: Use native lazy loading for below the fold iframes -->
<iframe src="https://example.com/map" width="800" height="600" loading="lazy" title="Example Map"></iframe>
```

## Service Workers & Caching Strategies

Client-side caching via Service Workers allows applications to bypass the network entirely, serving resources from disk/memory.

### DOs
*   **DO use a `CacheFirst` strategy for static, versioned assets**: Immutable files (fonts, JS/CSS bundles with hash strings) should be served directly from the cache to guarantee instant loading.
*   **DO use `StaleWhileRevalidate` for dynamic, non-critical resources**: For API calls where slight staleness is acceptable, serve immediately from cache while silently updating the cache in the background.
*   **DO implement a `NetworkFirst` strategy for HTML documents**: Ensure the user always receives the latest application shell and manifest, falling back to cache only if offline.
*   **DO restrict cache sizes and expiry**: Use expiration plugins to prevent the Service Worker from exhausting the device's storage quota.

### DON'Ts
*   **DON'T cache opaque responses blindly**: Responses from third-party domains lacking CORS headers are "opaque". Caching them heavily consumes quota and fails silently. Only cache them using `NetworkFirst` or `StaleWhileRevalidate`.
*   **DON'T cache POST requests**: Service workers cannot cache non-GET requests natively. Implement background sync queues for offline submissions.
*   **DON'T bypass versioning**: Failing to update asset hashes/versions will trap users in infinite cache loops.

### Code Examples

**JS: Service Worker Caching via Workbox**
```javascript
import { registerRoute } from 'workbox-routing';
import { CacheFirst, StaleWhileRevalidate, NetworkFirst } from 'workbox-strategies';
import { ExpirationPlugin } from 'workbox-expiration';
import { CacheableResponsePlugin } from 'workbox-cacheable-response';

// 1. HTML Documents: Network First
registerRoute(
  ({ request }) => request.mode === 'navigate',
  new NetworkFirst({ cacheName: 'pages-cache' })
);

// 2. Static Assets (JS, CSS, Fonts): Cache First
registerRoute(
  ({ request }) => ['style', 'script', 'font'].includes(request.destination),
  new CacheFirst({
    cacheName: 'static-resources',
    plugins: [
      new CacheableResponsePlugin({ statuses: [0, 200] }),
      new ExpirationPlugin({ maxEntries: 50, maxAgeSeconds: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 })
    ]
  })
);

// 3. API Responses: Stale While Revalidate
registerRoute(
  ({ url }) => url.pathname.startsWith('/api/v1/content'),
  new StaleWhileRevalidate({
    cacheName: 'api-cache',
    plugins: [
      new CacheableResponsePlugin({ statuses: [0, 200] })
    ]
  })
);
```

## Web Fonts Optimization

Web fonts are a common source of render blocking. Optimizing them reduces the Flash of Invisible Text (FOIT) and speeds up initial rendering.

### DOs
*   **DO preload critical fonts**: Use `<link rel="preload" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>` for fonts seen above the fold.
*   **DO subset fonts**: Trim font weights and glyph variations to include only the characters your application requires.

### DON'Ts
*   **DON'T preload all fonts**: Over-preloading leads to network contention that starves other critical assets.

### Code Examples

**CSS: Font Loading Face**
```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Modern Sans';
  src: url('/fonts/modern-sans.woff2') format('woff2');
}
```

**HTML: Critical Font Preload**
```html
<!-- Always use crossorigin for fonts even if on the same origin -->
<link rel="preload" href="/fonts/modern-sans.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>
```

## Video Performance & Metrics

Video payloads are among the heaviest assets. Optimization focuses on reducing bandwidth stall and preserving Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) stability.

### DOs
*   **DO specify explicit `width` and `height` attributes**: Setting native dimensions reserves layout space and prevents CLS.
*   **DO provide a `poster` image fallback**: Display a lightweight image placeholder while the video buffers to improve perceived performance.
*   **DO use `preload="none"` for non-critical videos**: Delay bandwidth consumption for below-the-fold or non-autoplaying videos.
*   **DO serve modern formats via source negotiation**: Offer WebM (better compression ratio) alongside standard MP4 formats.
*   **DO use `loading="lazy"` for offscreen videos**: Lazy-loading videos allow `poster` and `preload` downloads to be deferred until the video is in or near the viewport.

### DON'Ts
*   **DON'T auto-play video files blindly**: Rely on user intent or use progressive enhancement streams.
*   **DON'T auto-play large video files at all**: Rely on user intent before downloading large files.

### Code Examples

**HTML: Accessible and Dynamic Video Loader**
```html
<video 
  controls 
  width="1200" 
  height="675"
  poster="/images/video-poster.webp" 
  preload="none"
>
  <source src="/videos/intro.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source src="/videos/intro.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <!-- Include accessibility tracks -->
  <track src="/video-caps.vtt" kind="captions" srclang="en" label="English">
</video>
```

## JavaScript Code-Splitting

Heavy monolithic bundles block main thread parse times on low-end devices. Splitting ensures we only download bytes required for the immediate viewport.

### DOs
*   **DO use dynamic imports**: Split routes or heavy UI libraries using standard `import()` specifications.
*   **DO configure bundler asset chunking**: Use Vite or Webpack rollup directives to split third-party vendors from runtime application logic.

### DON'Ts
*   **DON'T ship a single, enormous `app.js` bundle**: It increases parse time and memory consumption for initial views.

### Code Examples

**JS: Route based Dynamic Splitting**
```javascript
// Dynamic import of heavy module only when button is clicked
document.getElementById('heavy-btn').addEventListener('click', async () => {
  const { heavyFunction } = await import('./heavy-module.js');
  heavyFunction();
});
```

# Identify causes of poor INP

Poor responsiveness to interactions leads to a poor impression of a page being slow or even completely broken. Interaction to Next Paint (INP) is a metric based on the Event Timing API. It measures the worst interaction (minus some outliers) as a measure of the page's responsiveness.

Identifying root causes of an unresponsive web page can be tricky especially as it depends on user interactions and environmental conditions such as device capabilities and network conditions. This makes it even more difficult to diagnose compared to a more repeatable and predictable scenario like page load. Lab data only replicates a small subset of real user scenarios so measuring the causes of slow INP in the field is essential.

The Event Timing API allows for splitting the INP duration into three subparts: Input Delay (processing that is already happing when the interaction happens), Processing Duration (delays due as a direct result of the interaction), and Presentation Delay (delays that are due to rendering the next frame after the interaction). This helps identify if the issue is in other code, the interaction JavaScript code, or browser processing rendering updates respectively rather than jumping straight to the interaction code.

It is possible to gather further insights for JavaScript code delaying an interaction. A full performance trace using the JS Self-Profiling API is a heavyweight solution that is liable to cause performance problems. The Long Animation Frames API is a lightweight API that can be used to identify slow running JavaScript in the field for INP interactions.

## How to implement

Calculating INP from the raw Event Timing API is complicated and has several nuances. You are advised to use a RUM tool or library to gather this data.

`web-vitals` is an open-source library from Google that calculates the Core Web Vitals including INP, and also includes subparts and long animation frame data for the INP interaction.

## Get attributions for INP interactions using web-vitals library

The `web-vitals` library is a tiny library used to measure Core Web Vitals and other performance metrics. The `onINP()` function can be used to identify the slowest interaction and includes information about the INP subparts and scripts that were executed during the interaction using the Long Animation Frames API.

```javascript
// Use the attribution build to get Long Animation Frame data
// alongside the INP metric value.
import { onINP } from 'web-vitals/attribution';

onINP((metric) => {
  // Beacon script attribution for the longest script during the INP
  // interaction, so you can identify the root cause in production.
  navigator.sendBeacon(
    '/analytics',
    JSON.stringify({
      name: 'INP',
      value: metric.value,
      // These fields give the INP subparts:
      inputDelay: metric.attribution.inputDelay,
      presentationDelay: metric.attribution.presentationDelay,
      processingDuration: metric.attribution.processingDuration,
      interactionTarget: metric.attribution.interactionTarget,
      // These fields identify which script function was responsible
      // for the longest processing during the INP interaction.
      invokerType: metric.attribution.longestScript.entry?.invokerType,
      sourceURL: metric.attribution.longestScript.entry?.sourceURL,
      sourceFunctionName: metric.attribution.longestScript.entry?.sourceFunctionName,
      sourceCharPosition: metric.attribution.longestScript.entry?.sourceCharPosition,
      // subpart indicates which phase (input delay, processing, or
      // presentation delay) the longest script overlapped with most.
      subpart: metric.attribution.longestScript.subpart,
      intersectingDuration: metric.attribution.longestScript.intersectingDuration
    })
  );
});
```

## Best Practices

- **DO** use INP subparts initially to identify whether the delay is already running JavaScript (input delay), the event handlers JavaScript for the interaction (processing duration), or the subsequent rendering (presentation delay).
- **DO** attempt to identify the biggest blocking JavaScript as additional detail, particularly for input delay, and processing duration.
- **DO** prefer the Long Animation Frames API for providing this further detail over alternatives like the JS Self-Profiling API, which carries higher runtime overhead.
- **DO** use the `web-vitals` library if no other RUM solution is in place. It can identify the INP interaction and includes information about the subparts and the scripts that were executed during the interaction (using the Long Animation Frames API).
- **DO** beacon back the required information to an analytics service rather than just log it locally.

## Browser support and fallback strategies

Baseline status for Event timing: Newly available. It's been Baseline since 2025-12-12.
Supported by: Chrome 76 (Jul 2019), Edge 79 (Jan 2020), Firefox 89 (Jun 2021), and Safari 26.2 (Dec 2025).

The Event Timing API is available in most modern browsers and is necessary to calculate INP and the INP subparts. For browsers that do not support this API INP cannot be measured.

Long animation frames has limited availability.
Supported by: Chrome 123 (Mar 2024) and Edge 123 (Mar 2024).
Unsupported in: Firefox and Safari.

The Long Animation Frames API provides optional, additional details. It can be safely used without fallbacks. In most cases the performance opportunities it identifies will apply to other browsers as well.


--- Guide for optimize-image-priority ---
# Optimize image priority

Browsers use heuristics to assign loading priorities to images, but these defaults may not always align with your page's Largest Contentful Paint (LCP). Using `fetchpriority` on an `<img>` element allows you to explicitly signal an image's importance to the browser, ensuring critical images load faster while non-essential ones don't compete for bandwidth.

## How to implement

1. **Identify the LCP image**: Determine which image is the most likely candidate for the Largest Contentful Paint (usually the hero image at the top of the page).
2. **Elevate LCP priority**: Add `fetchpriority="high"` to the `<img>` element for the LCP candidate.
3. **Deprioritize non-critical images**: For images that are part of a secondary UI or are only revealed after user interaction (like mega menus, modals, or off-screen carousel slides), add `fetchpriority="low"`.
4. **Optimize lazy loading**: Never use `loading="lazy"` on the LCP image. For standard below-the-fold images, `loading="lazy"` is sufficient to defer the request until the user scrolls near them. Avoid adding `fetchpriority="low"` to these images, as you want them to load at normal priority once the user scrolls to them. Reserve `fetchpriority="low"` for images that are technically "above the fold" but not initially visible (e.g., hidden carousel slides or mega menus). For these hidden images, it is acceptable to use `loading="lazy"` as well; the browser will handle the request timing while respecting the low priority.
5. **Prefer default priorities**: If an image should have normal loading priority, omit the `fetchpriority` attribute entirely rather than setting it to `auto`. This is a stylistic convention to keep your HTML cleaner while relying on the browser's native heuristics.

## Example code

```html
<!-- Elevate priority for the LCP image -->
<img src="/images/hero-lcp.jpg"
     alt="Main Banner"
     fetchpriority="high"
     width="800" height="400">

<!-- Deprioritize initially hidden images above the fold -->
<img src="/images/gallery-alt.jpg"
     alt="Gallery Image"
     fetchpriority="low"
     width="400" height="300">

<!-- Deprioritize images revealed only after user interaction -->
<img src="/images/mega-menu-promo.jpg"
     alt="Special Offer"
     fetchpriority="low"
     width="300" height="150">

<!-- Use lazy loading ALONE for standard below-the-fold images -->
<img src="/images/footer-logo.png"
     alt="Footer Logo"
     loading="lazy"
     width="120" height="60">

<!-- Omit fetchpriority for images with standard priority -->
<img src="/images/standard-image.jpg"
     alt="Standard Image"
     width="400" height="300">
```

## Best practices

- **MANDATORY**: Always apply `fetchpriority="high"` to the LCP image.
- **MANDATORY**: Only use `fetchpriority="high"` on at most 1-2 critical images to avoid network contention and diluting the priority boost.
- **MANDATORY**: Use `fetchpriority="low"` for images that are technically "above the fold" but initially hidden (e.g., hidden carousel slides, mega menu images).
- **MANDATORY**: **Do not** use `fetchpriority="low"` on standard below-the-fold images that are already using `loading="lazy"`. These images should load at normal priority once they enter the viewport.
- **RECOMMENDED**: Avoid using `fetchpriority="auto"`. If you want the default priority, omit the attribute entirely to keep your HTML clean.
- **DO NOT** combine `fetchpriority="high"` with `loading="lazy"` for the LCP image.
- **DO NOT** use the deprecated `importance` attribute. It has been replaced by `fetchpriority` and is not supported by any browser.

## Fallback strategy

Baseline status for Fetch priority: Newly available. It's been Baseline since 2024-10-29.
Supported by: Chrome 103 (Jun 2022), Edge 103 (Jun 2022), Firefox 132 (Oct 2024), and Safari 17.2 (Dec 2023).

The `fetchpriority` attribute is a progressive enhancement for the `<img>` element. If a browser does not support it, the attribute is ignored, and the browser uses its default priority heuristics.


--- Guide for optimize-preload-priority ---
# Optimize preload priority

Preloading resources with `<link rel="preload">` signals to the browser that a resource will be needed soon. However, preloads inherit the default priority for the resource type and for images in particular this is low. Using `fetchpriority` allows you to refine this relative priority, in particular ensuring image preloads are preloaded with a high priority allowing them to start earlier and use get more bandwidth resources.

## How to implement

1. **Identify preload candidates**: Find resources that are not discovered early by the browser (e.g., video poster images or background images in CSS) but are essential for the page's appearance.
2. **Elevate critical image preloads**: For the LCP image or other critical images that are not prioritized by default, use `<link rel="preload" fetchpriority="high">` to ensure they are prioritized above other preloads. Note that fonts are already high priority by default.
3. **Deprioritize non-critical preloads**: For resources that aren't critical for the initial render (e.g., a background video or secondary fonts), use `<link rel="preload" fetchpriority="low">`.
4. **Coordinate with resource types**: Note that different `as` types have different default priorities; use `fetchpriority` to override these defaults when necessary.

## Example code

```html
<!-- Elevate priority for a video poster image that acts as the LCP candidate -->
<link rel="preload" href="/images/video-poster.jpg" as="image" fetchpriority="high">

<!-- Elevate priority for a critical LCP image that is hidden in CSS -->
<link rel="preload" href="/images/hero-background.jpg" as="image" fetchpriority="high">

<!-- Deprioritize a secondary font to avoid network contention -->
<link rel="preload" href="/fonts/secondary-font.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" fetchpriority="low" crossorigin>
```

## Best Practices

- **MANDATORY**: Only use `fetchpriority="high"` on at most 1-2 critical image preloads to avoid network contention and diluting the priority boost.
- **MANDATORY**: Use `fetchpriority="high"` on Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) images.
- **DO**: Limit the total number of preloads on a page to at most 2 images and 2-3 essential fonts to prevent bandwidth contention.
- **DO** use `fetchpriority="low"` for preloads that you want the browser to start early but not at the expense of critical resources (especially non-critical fonts).
- **DO** specify the `as` attribute correctly to ensure the preload will be used.
- **DO** prefer making critical resources (like LCP images) statically discoverable in HTML via `<img>` tags rather than relying on preloads for background images.
- **DO** ensure that font preloads always have the `crossorigin` attribute (even if same-origin).
- **DO NOT** use the deprecated `importance` attribute. It has been replaced by `fetchpriority`.

## Fallback strategy

Baseline status for Fetch priority: Newly available. It's been Baseline since 2024-10-29.
Supported by: Chrome 103 (Jun 2022), Edge 103 (Jun 2022), Firefox 132 (Oct 2024), and Safari 17.2 (Dec 2023).

The `fetchpriority` attribute on `<link rel="preload">` is a progressive enhancement. Browsers that do not support it will still preload the resource using their default priority for that resource type. To ensure compatibility, always provide correct `as` and `type` attributes.
